These tools, which we will pursue in Part 2 of this book, are useful across the boundaries of subjects and disciplines, from mathematics, to the physical, biological, and human sciences, to the humanities. Because they are relevant for all disciplines, we call them trans-disciplinary. As you work through the exposition and exercises in the book, keep an eye out for these tools, and pay attention to the way they lead you to knowledge.
