And we might add: Higher Order Cognition is the mental capacity to acquire, construct, and evaluate what is transmitted as ‘knowledge’ in schools and colleges.    What does all this mean? For an experiential understanding of these goals described above, you need to work through at least the first three chapters of the book.

What we Expect you will Learn   You may find this book very different from all the textbooks you are familiar with. There are at least two reasons for this.  1. The focus here is not on ‘information’ and ‘knowledge’. This material will not help you get the specific knowledge content of any particular subject. The aim is for you to develop the general abilities you need for inquiring and thinking critically.   So instead of teaching you the proof of, say, the Pythagoras theorem, we will look at how to prove something, whether in math, the sciences, or the humanities. Rather than learning the correlation between temperature and pressure in a body of gas — that the pressure of a body of gas increases as its temperature increases; or the causes of world wars, you will learn how to see correlations between variables, and to find out'),\n",

What you would learn, including the abilities mentioned in (1), are relevant for all subjects and subject groups: it does not belong to any particular subject or ‘discipline’ or to any subject group. We call this kind of learning trans-disciplinary. As we proceed, you will begin to see what that means. If you are curious to know more about the book, or get a better idea about its aims, there are a few things you can do: ~ Go through the table of contents of the book, for an overview.   ~ Read Chapters 1 and 10.

They provide value-added help which begins after students have engaged directly with the materials. The teacher would respond to clarificatory and exploratory questions from students, and provide further guidance by asking questions, setting more exercises, and getting students more engaged.

What would I learn from this book?  Of what value would that learning be for me?   Let us find out.  First, what is Inquiry? When someone asks us a question in an examination or an interview, they expect us to give an answer using facts or procedures that we have learnt. For example, if someone were to ask us what the boiling point of water is, what we have stored in our memory would tell us that it is 100 degrees centigrade.  Suppose someone says: “Take a rectangular room 12 meters wide and 15 meters long. What is its area?” A quick mental calculation would tell us that it is 180 square meters because we know the formula for the area of a rectangle, and we know how to do the necessary calculation.'),\n",

We are talking about a situation where we: • don’t know the answer to a question;  • can’t get the answer by making calculations;  • can’t find anyone who knows the answer; and  • can’t find an answer on the Internet.'),\n",

Inquiry is not to be confused with ENQUIRY, which is asking for information, as in: I enquired after their health. I made an enquiry at the counter. In such cases, we would have to rely on our ability to think and figure out a good answer. Inquiry is the process of looking for an answer through thinking — either on one’s own or collectively with others.   India’s new National Education Policy (NEP 2020) talks about the need for students to develop ‘higher-order cognitive abilities’.  But what exactly are higher-order cognitive abilities? How do they relate to cognition, inquiry, critical thinking, and  problem solving? To help you find answers to questions like these, the book is dotted with conversations between:  !

The dialogues between Anu and Neel may seem to be about whether white crows exist. In fact, they are more about the value of doubting and questioning what we believe to be true. They show that to give reasons to defend a position, one must articulate that position as clearly and precisely as possible.

In Chapter 1, in the context of Higher Order Cognition, which we take to be the same as Academic Cognition, we saw the word ‘cognitive’, meaning “related to knowledge.”  There are many paths to knowing and knowledge. We may come to know something through our experience, from what is communicated to us by others through speech or writing, through reasoning, or a combination. For instance, from our experience we come to know that falling down can cause painful bruises. We get to know from another person, a piece of writing, or an audio/video recording, that a cobra bite can be fatal. And our reasoning tells us that if Neel is taller than Rafa, and Rafa is taller than Anu, then Neel is taller than Anu.  We use the term inquiry to refer the way of coming to know something on the basis of our own reasoning, often but not necessarily combined with what our experience tells us or what others tell us.'),\n",

Their next challenge was designing an experiment to find out if tulsi tea cures the common cold. They took several hours to come up with a plan. Once they had agreed on it, Rafa and Samira cycled back home, with thoughts of the delicious poori and aamras lunch waiting for them. 2.2 Inquiry through Reflection    On the way, a thought suddenly struck Rafa. Riding his bicycle, Rafa imagined the earth as a ball — a perfectly smooth sphere, without mountains, rivers, or oceans. He could keep riding without any obstruction, without changing his direction. What would happen if he kept on riding, without stopping? The answer that emerged in his mind surprised him: he would return to where he had started. Whichever direction he was riding in, as long as he didn’t change direction, he would come back to his starting point.  Now another thought struck him. He said to himself: “A straight line is a path that does not change its direction.” But a path of what?  He imagined himself'),\n",

A straight line is the path traced by a moving point that does not change its direction. Was that a definition of a straight line? Yes. And a pretty good one too!  He was beginning to feel excited. The bicycle path that he was thinking of was a straight line. Given the size of the earth, a bicycle is so small that it can be thought of as a point.  He went back to thinking about his earlier conclusion: if he were riding his bicycle on a smooth spherical earth in a straight path, he would return to the point from which he started the ride. Now, if he was a point, then given his definition, he could conclude that:  Every straight line, extended on a spherical surface, would meet itself.  Would that be the case on a flat surface?

His teacher had told him that the geometry that he was learning in school was called Euclidean geometry. This was a flat surface geometry. But there was another geometry called spherical geometry. Rafa didn’t know much about spherical geometry, except that it was a part of non-flat geometry. He had also read that while Newton’s theory of gravity and motion was based on flat geometry, Einstein’s theory was based on non-flat geometry.'),\n",

Can you tell me what your main propositions are? Let’s write them down. Rafa: Huh? What are propositions? Samira: A proposition is what a sentence asserts. In simpler words, a proposition is what we mean by a sentence. Let me give you an example. Suppose I wrote down four sentences:   (i) Point A comes before point B.   (ii) Point A precedes point B.   (iii) Point B comes after point A.   (iv) Point B follows point A.  Don’t these sentences all mean the same thing? Rafa: Of course they do.

What is inquiry? What is research? As we said in Chapter 1, we use the term inquiry to refer to the process of looking for an answer through one’s own thinking, and discussions with others.  In chapter 2, we identified the components of inquiry as:   formulating questions to express what we do not know;   looking for and finding answers;  arriving at conclusions on the basis of our answers;   critically evaluating the conclusions; and  accepting the conclusions if there are good reasons to do so.

Problems have to do with either a gap in something that currently exists and is desirable, or something that is undesirable in the current state of affairs. For instance, a world without suffering, poverty, hatred, and violence is desirable, but as the world exists today, it is full of suffering, poverty, hatred, and violence. The gap between the two is a problem that we need to look for solutions to. Our lack of understanding of the Corona virus is undesirable: that is another problem that we must look for solutions to.

For instance, given the question, “What is the tilt of the earth?” the student is expected to access the correct answer already stored in memory, and respond with “23.5 degrees” in less than a minute.  Inquiry questions don’t have such ready answers. When facilitators ask an inquiry question, they expect the novice inquirers to not know the answer, but to look for AN answer (not THE answer), arrive at a conclusion, and rationally justify the conclusion. If you look back at Chapters 1-3, you will find several examples of such inquiry questions.

Research can be viewed as inquiry that aims to make a contribution to the existing pool of collective knowledge. So, both school students and PhD students can engage in inquiry, and both begin their investigation with a question that they do not have an answer to. However, it would be unrealistic to expect school students to make a contribution to the collective pool of knowledge, while that is a standard expectation of a research thesis. 2.

We will call this the PDC structure of reasoning.  Now, to identify this structure in running texts, we have to understand how certain words signal certain kinds of logical relations. Let us look closely at some of these words. 5.1 The words ‘therefore’ and ‘hence’  To go back to what we said earlier, a good example of words that signal logical relations is therefore.

This becomes clear when we compare it with what we saw in PC5, repeated below as PC6, with a conclusion added in instead of a question mark:  PC6: P1 Athena loves Apollo.   P2 Apollo loves Zeno.   C Therefore, Athena loves Zeno.  As we saw earlier, PC5 is not an example of good reasoning, because given the meaning of loves, neither “Athena loves Zeno,” nor “Athena doesn’t love Zeno,” follows logically from the premises.  Thus, while the reasoning in the examples with “x is taller than y,” and “x is a sibling of y,” are instances of good reasoning, the reasoning in examples with “x loves y” is flawed.

Some domains of academic knowledge, such as mathematics, computer. science, formal logic, and the physical sciences also create specialized algebraic and diagrammatic notations for concepts and propositions to encode the knowledge of the field.

The most common mode of communication among humans is that of natural languages like English, Hindi, Malayalam, Japanese, Arabic, Russian, Spanish, and so on. We also pointed out that the words in our everyday use of natural languages tends to be unclear and ambiguous. That property is undesirable for the communication of academic knowledge, especially for academic arguments. The terminology of academic knowledge and academic inquiry calls for a high degree of conceptual clarification, often in terms of clear and precise definitions.

Anu: Neel and I checked. There is no textbook that says which of them we should adopt. They sat wondering for a few seconds. Anu: But Rafa, why do we need to choose one of them? Why can’t we use both? Rafa: Because if we choose your classification, and find white ravens, we must admit that there are white crows too. But my diagram doesn’t lead us to the same conclusion. Our classifications have different logical consequences. That’s why we need to find a way to choose one. Anu: Oh, right, that makes sense.

For example, young children label toys like building blocks by colour (using words like red, blue, green, yellow), or by shape (round, square, triangle). Words in all languages express classes: river, star, planet, animal, vertebrate, insect, plant, flower, boy, girl, and country signal the way we group what we see in nature. Words like table, chair, house, book, and poem indicate our classification of man-made entities. As Neel points out, classification is also a fundamental tool employed by every academic disciplines. While a category is a set of entities, not all sets are categories.

Another classification, attributed to the scholar Prashastapaada (5th c.

And what is the difference between subsets and subcategories? The answer is that categories are a special kind of sets. Let us define the concept of categories as follows: A CATEGORY is a set whose members have at least one common trait that distinguishes it from the members of all other sets.  Take, for instance, the following set:   { the set of numbers from 23 to 315, the set of books that Harry read between 2003 and 2016, the set of students in this course}  The members of this set have no discernible trait in common that includes, say, 25 and the Harry Potter books, but excludes 25.7,'),\n",

Learning becomes easier if we understand that in academic knowledge, words like triangle, polygon, mammal, insect, male, female, science, etc. express categories.

There are two important questions that came up in the conversations in this chapter: Question 1: How do we choose between alternative ways of classifying a set of entities? The answer is simple. We choose the classification from which we can make the most number of inferences from the smallest number of premises. We used this criterion in choosing to classify squares as a sub-category of rectangles rather than as a separate category.

We judge a category to be justified if it allows us to make inferences. A category that allows us to make more useful inferences than others has greater legitimacy.

This type of reasoning that allows us to arrive at a conclusion on a population from a sample is called INDUCTIVE REASONING, as distinct from DEDUCTIVE REASONING.

What exactly is a generalisation? He thought to himself:  A generalisation is a statement about a population.   So when a textbook says that all mammals have lungs, that statement is a generalisation because it is about the entire population of mammals, some of them currently existing, some of them already dead and gone, and some yet to be born.  What is a population? Well, it is clear that the members of any category are members of a population. But does every population constitute a category? All the living organisms in a city constitute the population of living organisms in that city. But they may not form a category. Perhaps the concept of a population is the same as the concept of a set, in that as in the case of the members of a set, it is not necessary that the members of a population have any shared properties.

Rafa decided to focus on populations that are categories, like dogs, mammals, vertebrates, and animals.  Then it hit him that to formulate statements about such populations, it is not possible to examine every member of the population. For example, to check if all mammals have lungs, there is no way to examine ALL mammals, as that population would include all the mammals that are dead, and all the mammals that are yet to be born. So the basis for making the generalisation must be a sample of the population that we have observed. When we observe a sample of mammals, we find that every member in that sample has lungs. So that is a property of the sample, a pattern in the sample. It was now clear to Rafa that a generalisation is what we say about a population on the basis of what we find in a sample.

Our judgment that such a generalisation is flawed led to an investigation of the distinction between generalisations that we judge to be legitimate, and those that we judge to be illegitimate or unfounded.    The journey that we shared with the main characters in our story in this chapter shows that generalisations are a central ingredient in mathematics, the physical-biological-human sciences, and human affairs in general, and even in matters of personal judgment.  It would be useful to bear in mind that generalisations are of many kinds, not all of them illustrated in the dialogues in the chapter.

Suppose we make a list of these things, so that anyone can check to see if everything is still there.

The concepts of ‘category’, ‘property’, and ‘definition’ play an important role in academic knowledge. In this chapter, we explore the concept of ‘definition’. In the process of exploration, we will learn how to define concepts, how to critically evaluate definitions, and how to choose between alternative definitions.  2 Defining Breathing   Rafa, Neel, and Anu were in class, talking in whispers while waiting for the teacher.

There is no water in the lungs of the body. So the person must have died before drowning. ~ Hence we conclude that the person died before the body hit the water. ~ Sudden death, causing a person to fall into the well while standing at its edge, is improbable.  ~ Besides, the bruise marks on the neck can be explained only if we assume that he was strangled to death.  ~ Hence, we conclude that he was killed.

A photograph of stars taken by an astronomer, measurements recorded by a physicist, an interview conducted by a sociologist, the words in a literary text that a literary critic draws attention to, and an ancient scroll discovered by a historian that serves as the basis for a claim — all these are forms of evidence.

Suppose we accept the following premises: 5) For any x, the proposition that x’s grandmother never had children is false.  6) For any x, the proposition that x was 5 years old when x’s grandmother was born is false.  7) For any x, if x is human, the proposition that x’s grandmother was a rabbit is false.

It is possible that x’s grandmother’s sister has children (as (8a) claims), and it is equally possible that she does not have children (as (8b) claims). So, without evidence either way, we cannot arrive at a judgment on (4). How about the general statements in (5)-(7)? How do we know if we should treat them as true? How do we justify these statements?   4.2 Axioms and Definitions  We can prove that (5) is true simply by defining the concepts of ‘mother’, ‘child’, and ‘(biological maternal) grandmother’: 9) a.

To prove (6), we need to add the following axioms (which we may take as obviously true) to our definitions in (9): 11) Axiom: a. A living organism x comes to exist when x is born.     b.

However, the proof here is a form of justification. 4.3 Argument An argument involves a chain of reasoning that connects the grounds to a conclusion. The extended reasoning that Zeno gives to justify his claim (that the dead man in the well was murdered) makes it an argument.

This activity does not qualify as an argument in rational inquiry. Another meaning of the term argument, popular in the humanities, is that of an extended elucidation of a claim, not necessarily supported by evidence and reasoning. In such cases, the statement: “I argue that modernity is harmful,” should be interpreted as: “I present the view, with details, that modernity is harmful.” It is important to distinguish this meaning of ‘argument’ from the concept of argument as evidence and/or reasoning in support of a conclusion.

In the Chapters in Part 2, we were introduced to the basics of reasoning largely in the context of arriving at inferences. For this, we used the structure of Premises, Derivation, and Conclusion (PDC). We were also introduced to logic as the study of reasoning, involving Rules of Inference.  In these chapters, we briefly explored causal reasoning as a specific form of reasoning. We saw how important it is to not confuse causation and correlation, when providing evidence and arguments or evaluating evidence and arguments in support of claims. Causal reasoning is a staple form of reasoning used not only in the academic domain but also in our personal,'),\n",

The English words ‘criticism’ and ‘criticise’ have similar associations of disapproval. When we say,“Athena criticised Zeno's work,” we mean, “Athena said something negative about Zeno's work.”  This is not what we mean by ‘critical’ in ‘critical thinking’.   The meaning of the term ‘criticism’ in what is called ‘literary criticism’ and ‘art criticism’ refers typically to what scholars call literary analysis and interpretation, and art appreciation.

Critical reading is closely tied to critical thinking. It is engaging critically with what we read, going beyond mere reading comprehension. The concepts of claim, justification, evidence, arguments, reasoning, premises, and conclusion are central to critical thinking as well as to critical reading. The activity of critical reading presupposes the capacity for reading comprehension. To get a sense of what that means, take a look at: “How to Read Non-Fiction,” at https://www.thinq.education/post/how-to-read-non-fiction. We may define Critical Reading as follows: Critical reading is the process of applying critical thinking to what one reads in order to arrive at an assessment of its merit.

If we accept that, we must reject the ancient scholars’ view that air and water are elements. But you know, maybe we don’t understand what they mean. What if they didn’t think of the so-called bhuutas as substances, but as abstract attributes? Anu: That’s a brilliant thought! Maybe for them, ‘water’ is not a substance made out of hydrogen and oxygen, but the attribute of wetness. And ‘earth’ means solidity, sort of like the planet.  Neel:  Interesting.

Critical reading is the process of applying critical thinking to what one reads in order to arrive at an assessment of its merit. We went through several examples of critical thinking in general, and of its specific application to critical reading in engaging with written or spoken texts that seek to communicate a body of collective knowledge. The activities in our examples of critical thinking (including critical reading) drew upon the tools of inquiry, including categorizing, clarifying concepts, defining, looking for counterexamples and counterevidence, identifying and articulating logical consequences, looking for logical contradictions, checking the validity of arguments, checking the credibility of the premises in it, and so on.

When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has a hunch as to what the result is, he is uncertain.

Rational temperament is what the Indian Constitution calls the scientific temper, when extended to all forms of rational inquiry including not only science, but also mathematics, and the humanities. The ingredients of the rational temperament are: (i) Intellectual curiosity; (ii) Joy of learning and of finding things out on one’s own; (iii) Openness to criticism: readiness to accept it in the spirit of self-correction; (iv) Intellectual skepticism: the habit of doubting and questioning values, norms, beliefs, and practices, our own and those of\"),\n",

That is, we do not dare to examine certain beliefs which could be easily contradicted by experience, because we are afraid of upsetting our emotional balance. There may be circumstances in which it is not unwise to cling to illusions, but in science we need a very different attitude, the inductive attitude. This attitude aims at adapting our beliefs to our experience as efficiently as possible. It requires a certain preference for what is matter of fact. It requires a ready ascent from observations to generalizations, and a ready descent from the highest generalizations to the most concrete observations. It requires saying \"maybe\" and \"perhaps\" in a thousand different shades. It requires many other things, especially the following three.
